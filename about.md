# Better Spawn Loop
When 2.2 released, a better way to create spawn loops was found, using the Spawn Ordered feature. This reduces the object and group usage down to 2 objects and 1 group for any size of spawn loop.
However, the create loop button uses the old style of creating spawn loops. This mod fixes that. 

To change the spawn loop after creation, you just need to place triggers where you want them to activate, set them to spawn triggered and multi-triggered, and add them to the group that the other triggers are a part of.
To change the length of the loop, you need to change the "Delay" in the lower spawn trigger
